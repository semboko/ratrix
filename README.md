# 🎮 Ratrix – A Terminal-Based Rust Tetris  

Welcome to **Ratrix** – a Tetris clone built in Rust for the terminal! 🚀  

## 🌟 Why Ratrix?  
There are plenty of Rust-based Tetris projects out there, but many are already complete and don't have many open issues for newcomers. **Ratrix is different.** This project is far from finished, meaning you have plenty of space to bring in your ideas, experiment, and make meaningful contributions!  

## ✨ Features  
- 🖥 **Custom TUI Layer** – Built from scratch, no heavy dependencies.  
- 🎯 **Optimized Rendering** *(Work in Progress)* – The game updates only on key events or when the playfield changes instead of redrawing the whole screen at 60 FPS.  
- 🏗 **Optimized Playfield & Piece Storage** – Uses **only 42 bits** for efficient board and piece representation.  
- ⚡ **Bitwise Operations for Collision Detection** – Enables **fast and efficient** piece movement and collision checking.  
- 🚀 **Beginner-Friendly Contribution** – Whether you're new to Rust or just finished reading *The Rust Programming Language*, you can use this project to practice everything you've learned!  

## 🎓 A Great Learning Opportunity  
If you're looking for a **real-world Rust project** to experiment with, **this is the place**! Want to practice ownership, lifetimes, iterators, pattern matching, or custom abstractions? **Feel free to bring your ideas here!**  

## 🤝 How to Contribute
